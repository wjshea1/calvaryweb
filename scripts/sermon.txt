Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his brothers did not have many children, nor did all their clan multiply like the men of Judah.

The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel (for he was the firstborn, but because he defiled his fathers couch, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, so that he could not be enrolled as the oldest son; though Judah became strong among his brothers and a chief came from him, yet the birthright belonged to Joseph), the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel'	'1Chronicles4-5-Downs'

In todays study, Pastor Gregg will explain the purpose of chapters 4-7, which list the genealogies of the returning exiles from the twelve tribes of Israel.  Today we will focus our attention on the area of land allotted to the tribe of Judah.

In addition, during our study today, we will consider a descendant of Judah, the man Jabez who prayed that God might bless him.

People are motivated to grow in their Christian lives in a number of ways. Sometimes, its just self discipline of getting in the Word or going to church whether you want to or not that then God touches a person. Other times you see something thats obviously God in action and that God moment motivates you to be more godly. I dont know if everyone has those. I do. Maybe thats because I tend to be more emotional or connect with people on an emotional level so I can connect with God that way too. And sometimes a God-moment strikes one person in a way that doesnt connect with someone else.

As you will see today, David though anointed to be the next king of Israel would nevertheless have to withstand many years of difficulties and challenges along the journey to the throne.

Today, we will take look at a major piece of the Last Days puzzle  the millennium.  Also known as the Kingdom Age, the millennium is the 1,000 year reign of Christ upon the earth at the close of the Tribulation.  Satan will be bound and righteousness will reign.  The earth will finally have its chance to flourish as God intended in the Garden of Eden.

During our study today, we will consider:

What is the Millennium?

Will the Millennium be a literal 1,000 years?

If Satan is bound, why is he later loosed?

Who will be with Christ during the Millennium?

At the conclusion of chapter 13, a significant transition occurred in the purpose of Gods Last Days judgment.  Prior to that point, each judgment from the throne of God was tempered with mercy for the purpose of bringing about repentance.  The opportunity for repentance ended however as the inhabitants of the earth were forced to either receive the mark of the beast and side with Satan, or face the temporal consequences and side with God.  From that point on, all of the judgments poured out in the seven last plagues (ch 15), plus the fall of both the Great Harlot (ch 17)and Babylon (ch 18) were for the purpose of preparing the earth to receive its returning King.  

Chapter 19 is a glorious chapter which depicts the physical return of the King of kings with His church.  It is a wonderful chapter that will stir you r heart for heaven.

In one of Jesus more well-known parables, He spoke of the wheat and the tares growing up alongside of one another.  In that story, the workers were told not to pull up the tares (weeds) at that time, lest in doing so they inadvertently pull up the wheat as well.  Instead, the workers were instructed to wait until the harvest.  Today, in our study of Revelation 14:6-20, we will look at that Great Harvest that Jesus spoke of, in which all would be judged by the Lord of all the Earth. 

Eternal life will be a reality for all, and while thoughts about an eternity in Heaven are pleasant to consider, Hell on the other hand is an uncomfortable topic that many of us would prefer to put out of our mind.

It is of these two figures and these dark days that Jesus would say, Unless those days were shortened, there would be no flesh upon the Earth. Amidst that darkness shines forth a great light though, for as the expansive power and complete dominion of the Antichrist is fully displayed in chapter 13, the glimpse of the glorious hope of a coming King is caught by John in Revelation 14 as the Lamb of God begins the establishment of His kingdom by setting His feet upon Mount Zion.

He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by human features, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only by his surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of the Divine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblem of that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Head of the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colour was a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of the new covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled with four-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church of God. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight and enjoyment they have of him.  Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospel church, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to be admitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his glorious presence in heaven.

The same Lord Jesus has the key of government and authority in and over the church. He opens a door of opportunity to his churches; he opens a door of utterance to his ministers; he opens a door of entrance, opens the heart. He shuts the door of heaven against the foolish, who sleep away their day of grace; and against the workers of iniquity, how vain and confident soever they may be. The church in Philadelphia is commended; yet with a gentle reproof. Although Christ accepts a little strength, yet believers must not rest satisfied in a little, but strive to grow in grace, to be strong in faith, giving glory to God. Christ can discover this his favour to his people, so that their enemies shall be forced to acknowledge it. This, by the grace of Christ, will soften their enemies, and make them desire to be admitted into communion with his people. Christ promises preserving grace in the most trying times, as the reward of past faithfulness; To him that hath shall be given. Those who keep the gospel in a time of peace, shall be kept by Christ in an hour of temptation; and the same Divine grace that has made them fruitful in times of peace, will make them faithful in times of persecution. Christ promises a glorious reward to the victorious believer. He shall be a monumental pillar in the temple of God; a monument of the free and powerful grace of God; a monument that shall never be defaced or removed. On this pillar shall be written the new name of Christ; by this will appear, under whom the believer fought the good fight, and came off victorious.'	'Revelation Chapter 3 verse 7 to 14'

             A song of praise for redeeming love is a new song, a mystery hidden from ages and generations. Converts sing a new song, very different from what they had sung. If the grace of God put a new heart into our breasts, it will put a new song into our mouths. Let this new song be sung to the praise of God, in consideration of the wonders he has wrought. The Redeemer has overcome all difficulties in the way of our redemption, and was not discouraged by the services or sufferings appointed him. Let us praise him for the discoveries made to the world of the work of redemption; his salvation and his righteousness fulfilling the prophecies and promises of the Old Testament. In pursuance of this design, God raised up his Son Jesus to be not only a Light to lighten the Gentiles, but the glory of his people Israel. Surely it behoves us to inquire whether his holy arm hath gotten the victory in our hearts, over the power of Satan, unbelief, and sin? If this be our happy case, we shall exchange all light songs of vanity for songs of joy and thanksgiving; our lives will celebrate the Redeemer's praise. Let all the children of men rejoice in the setting up the kingdom of Christ, for all may benefit by it. The different orders of rational creatures in the universe, seem to be described in figurative language in the reign of the great Messiah. The kingdom of Christ will be a blessing to the whole creation. We expect his second coming to begin his glorious reign. Then shall heaven and earth rejoice, and the joy of the redeemed shall be full. But sin and its dreadful effects will not be utterly done away, till the Lord come to judge the world in righteousness. Seeing then that we look for such things, let us give diligence that we may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.'	'Psalm Chapter 98 verses 1 to 9'

           God governs the world by his providence, governs the church by his grace, and both by his Son. The inhabitants of the earth have cause to tremble, but the Redeemer still waits to be gracious. Let all who hear, take warning, and seek his mercy. The more we humble ourselves before God, the more we exalt him; and let us be thus reverent, for he is holy. The happiness of Israel is made out by referring to the most useful governors of that people. They in every thing made God's word and law their rule, knowing that they could not else expect that their prayers should be answered. They all wonderfully prevailed with God in prayer; miracles were wrought at their request. They pleaded for the people, and obtained answers of peace. Our Prophet and High Priest, of infinitely greater dignity than Moses, Aaron, or Samuel, has received and declared to us the will of the Father. Let us not only exalt the Lord with our lips, but give him the throne in our heart; and while we worship him upon his mercy-seat, let us never forget that he is holy.'

           An exhortation to praise God, and rejoice in him. - This song of praise should be considered as a prophecy, and even used as a prayer, for the coming of that time when all people shall know that the Lord he is God, and shall become his worshippers, and the sheep of his pasture. Great encouragement is given us, in worshipping God, to do it cheerfully. If, when we strayed like wandering sheep, he has brought us again to his fold, we have indeed abundant cause to bless his name. The matter of praise, and the motives to it, are very important. Know ye what God is in himself, and what he is to you. Know it; consider and apply it, then you will be more close and constant, more inward and serious, in his worship. The covenant of grace set down in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, with so many rich promises, to strengthen the faith of every weak believer, makes the matter of God's praise and of his people's joys so sure, that how sad soever our spirits may be when we look to ourselves, yet we shall have reason to praise the Lord when we look to his goodness and mercy, and to what he has said in his word for our comfort.'
